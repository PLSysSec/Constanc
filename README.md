# Final project

Your final project consists of 3 parts:

- final project proposal (`proposal.md`)
- final project presentation
- final project paper (`paper/main.pdf`)

Use this repository to submit up your proposal and final paper.  You may use
this repository to collaborate with your teammates on your project. I will
generally not look at your code, unless you explicitly want me to help with
something.

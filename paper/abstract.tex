\begin{abstract}
In this paper we present \constc: a domain specific language for writing constant-time code. We describe the two main aspects of \constc: the high- and low-level languages. The high-level language includes general-purpose programming constructs such as conditionals and loops, while the low-level language is built off of constant-time primitives. We formalize a translation between the two languages which preserves functional equivalence. We then describe the compiler we built for \constc. Using the \constc compiler, we implement various cryptographic functions and verify they run in constant time.

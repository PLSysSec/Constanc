The security community has been aware of side channel attacks for over 40 years
\cite{lampson1973, wray1991, lipner1975, brumley2005remote}. Side channel attacks have been
shown to leak information from a variety of covert channels including power analysis\cite{Vaudenay2016},
cache access patterns\cite{liu2015}, and other aspects of processor architecture\cite{wang2004}.

There has much work in creating defenses against such attacks.
\cite{planul2013,mitchell2012} use information flow control
to prevent information leaks on encrypted data. \cite{stefan2013} uses
instruction-based scheduling to address cache based timing attacks.
\cite{stefan2012,buiras2014} address timing attacks in LIO, a concurrent
information flow control system for Haskell.

Most closely related to \constc, Molnar et.\ al.\ use C to C code transformations to avoid timing side
channels \cite{molnar2005}. Since they do not control assembly generation, their work is only useful
when using the Intel C compiler as described in their paper: they found that the GCC compiler would rewrite the \texttt{!}
operator in terms of a \texttt{jmp} instruction, breaking their constant-time guarantees.

Over the years, we have seen an increase in potential attack vectors for
malicious parties. One such attack vector is side channel attacks --- utlizing
leaked information to undermine the security of applications and systems.
Our related work is split into two main areas: a discussion on side channel
attakcs and mitigations as well as a discussion on constant time
implementations.

There has been a plethora of work done on the prevalence of side channel
attacks. 

Moverover, there has been plenty of work completed on avoiding these
side-channel attacks, mainly through variosu constant time implementations.

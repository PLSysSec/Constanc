The security community has been aware of side channel attacks for over 40 years
\cite{lampson1973, wray1991, lipner1975}. Recently, side channels have been
shown to leak information via power analysis\cite{Vaudenay2016}. Furthermore,
timing side channels have been shown to leak information from the
cache\cite{liu2015} or other aspects of processor architecture\cite{wang2004}.

Due to the rise in the number of side channel attacks, there has recently been a
rise in defenses. \cite{planul2013,mitchell2012} uses information flow control
to prevent information leaks on encrypted data. \cite{stefan2013} uses
instruction-based scheduling to address cache based timing attacks.
\cite{stefan2012,buiras2014} address timing attacks in LIO, a concurrent
information flow control system for Haskell. Most closely related to \constc,
\cite{molnar2005} uses C to C code transformations to avoid timing side
channels.

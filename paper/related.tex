\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}


Over the years, we have seen an increase in potential attack vectors for
malicious parties. One such attack vector is side channel attacks --- utlizing
leaked information to undermine the security of applications and systems.
Our related work is split into two main areas: a discussion on side channel
attacks and mitigations as well as a discussion on constant time
implementations.

Starting over 40 years ago \cite{lampson1973, wray1991, lipner1975}, there has
been a plethora of work on the prevalence of side channel attacks and the
problem of confinement. Side channels can be used in power
analysis\cite{Vaudenay2016,koziel2016} to detect certain computations, or in
networking and the TCP/IP protocol\cite{zander2007,cabuk2004,rowland1997} and
also in memory\cite{liu20152,hund2013,liu2015}. Moreover, there has been a
extensive amount of work on timing attacks\cite{wang2004,kopf2009}. Our focus
is on timing attacks and memory attacks and is thus more closely related to
those works. 

Moverover, there has been plenty of work completed on avoiding these
side-channel attacks, mainly through various programming language institutions.
For example, there has been a vast array of work that looks at information flow
control in order to avoid or control the covert channels for both timing and
memory\cite{planul2013,mitchell2012,stefan2013,stefan2012,buiras2014}. We
decide to take a slightly different approach and attack this problem at the
language level, instead of employing information flow control tactics. The work
that is most closely related to us\cite{molnar2005} also uses transformations
to avoid side channel attacks in C code. The main difference in our work and
theirs is that we plan to create a library so that developers do not need to
write in our language if they do not desire to do so.

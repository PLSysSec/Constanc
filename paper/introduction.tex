\section{Introduction}

Timing side channels are an important class of security bugs whereby an attacker
is able use the timing of events in a system to discern secret data. One well-known
timing attack was the ``Lucky 13'' attack against various SSL implementations \cite{al2013lucky},
which used minute differences in the duration between a malicious request to a server and
the resulting error message to recover an SSL session key.

Due to the sensitive nature of data that can be leaked from timing attacks, developers
must take extra care to defend against such attacks. The current state-of-the-art
used in many cryptographic libraries is constant-time programming. The idea behind
constant-time programming is to structure code so that the time a program
takes to run is not influenced by sensitive data. There are three main issues
with constant-time programming: First, it restricts how the developer
can use high level constructs like if-statements and loops, making the code
difficult to read and write. This level of complexity can easily cause the
developer to write buggy code if it is not tested properly \cite{al2013lucky}. Second,
since the code is written in a high level language, a developer may be using operations
that are not actually constant time (\eg floating point division).
Finally, the compiler may optimize constant-time code to form a program
that is not actually constant time.

We address the need to easily write verified constant-time code by making several
contributions to constant-time programming: We formalize a core
language, \ccore, built using constant-time low-level primitives;
we formalize code transformations from our high-level language,
\constc, to our core language; we build a compiler for
\constc that produces constant-time functions that can be linked into and called from C code;
and finally, we implement cryptographic functions in \constc and verify they run in constant time with
\emph{ct-verif} tool\cite{almeida2016}.

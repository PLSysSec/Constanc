\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

Our goal for this quarter was to create a few implementations in our language to
show that this concept is feasible and worth further research. As such, we have
a plethora of future work that we would like to explore in the months to follow.
The simplest to tackle is the creation of a syntax for our language ---
currently we must write programs directly in the AST. Having a corresponding
syntax is key to stabilizing our language.

Another useful feature will be the concept of public and private labels on data.
Our language currently treats all values as private --- we would like to augment
it to be able to relax restrictions on data that does not need protection which allow for more programmer flexibility.

Finally, an important goal of this project is to determine a method of usability
testing for programming languages. A huge impediment in this task is that there
are currently no meaningful ways of user testing programming languages at scale.
One needs to be able to find a key group of users and be able to test in-depth
at a large scale in order to get proper data. This is an open question that we
are hoping to address in the following months.

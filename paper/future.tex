\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

Our goal for this quarter was to create a few implementations in our language to
show that this concept is feasible and worth further research. As such, we have a
plethora of future work that we would like to explore in the months to follow.
The simplest to tackle is the creation of a syntax for our
language --- currently we must write programs directly in the AST.
Having a corresponding syntax is key to stabilizing our language.

Another useful feature will be the concept of public and private labels on data.
Our language currently treats all values as private --- we would like to augment it
to be able to relax restrictions on data that does not need protection.
Along these lines, we also would also like to expand
the notion of our side channel safety to domains beyond timing, such as memory safety and
prevention against caching side channels.

Finally, an important goal of this project is to determine a method of usability
testing for programming languages. A huge impediment in this task is that there
are currently no meaningful ways of testing programming languages at scale --- it is not a task that
one can easily part out, such as with Amazon Mechanical Turk\cite{mechanicalturk}. One needs to
be able to find a key group of users and be able to test in-depth at a large scale
in order to get proper data. This is an open question that we are hoping to
address in the following months.

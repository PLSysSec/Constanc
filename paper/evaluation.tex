\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
We were not able to evaluate our implementation due to a variety of reasons.

For one, we were not able to run our implementations through CT Verif\cite{almeida2016}
We do not have public labels, which means that we can't in memory
reference. This violates one of CT Verif's policies. 

Moreover, we were not able to perform microbenchmarks on this fucntion because
it would not have been fair. We only implemented one function that cannot stand
on it's own --- in order to truly test this, we would like to implement the
functinos needed to encrypt and decrypt, so that we can test the function is
it's full form.

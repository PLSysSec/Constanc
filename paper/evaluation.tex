\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
We were not able to evaluate our implementation due to a variety of reasons.

\cite{almeida2016}

Moreover, we were not able to perform microbenchmarks on this fucntion because
it would not have been fair. We only implemented one function that cannot stand
on it's own --- in order to truly test this, we would like to implement the
functinos needed to encrypt and decrypt, so that we can test the function is
it's full form.

TODO: Note that the branch in~\ref{fig:openssl-original} is legal since the lengths in the conditional are public.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced \constc, a high level language that can be used for constant-time programming. We formalized the semantics of \constc and \ccore and the transformation from \constc to \ccore. With this formalization, we built a \constc compiler which we successfully used to rewrite the \path{ssl3_cbc_remove_padding} function from OpenSSL. In the future, we plan to evaluate \constc based on performance and usability. Furthermore, we plan to create a syntax for \constc and implement a lexer and parser for the compiler. Finally, we plan to add public labels to the type system allowing for more flexibility for the developer and better performance.

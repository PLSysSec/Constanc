## ConstanC Contributor Guidelines

The goal of this document is to ensure that all contributors are synced on how to contribute.

### Pull Requests

Each pull request should have a corresponding ticket in trello.

Each pull request should accomplish a single task. Types of tasks are bugs, features, or refactors.

Commit messages should follow [these 7 rules](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) to the best of your ability.

Pull requests must be approved by Gary or Sunjay.


### Style

Use merlin.

If merlin does not tell you the answer, look at the rest of the codebase.

Gary will hunt you down if you go over 80 characters. Or use tabs. If your code doesn't compile, then dig your own grave.

If you can't find the answer anywhere, use [these guidelines](https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/guidelines.html)
